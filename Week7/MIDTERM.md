# Midterms (Due March 18th)

Your midterm presentation is due on Tuesday, March 18th. Be sure to document your project with either a slideshow or a markdown file inside your class repo.

### What to Include in Your Documentation & Presentation:

- A demo of your site and the progress you have made.
- A snippet of code you figured out (this could be from a tutorial you adapted, a challenge you solved, or a piece of responsive behavior you implemented).
- Next steps: If you had more time, what would you improve? Are you planning to expand this for your final?
- Your midterm project code and documentation (and a copy of your slideshow, if applicable) must be present in your repo.
- The presentation is part of your midterm grade.

_I will not be grading your code until Thursday, **March 20th**. Please ensure that your project is uploaded to your GitHub Pages by then and that it is functioning as intended. All links and interactions should be working properly._

### Understanding Your Own Code

During your presentation, you should be able to walk through your code and explain how it works. If I ask you about a specific function, animation, or interaction, you should be able to break it down. This is to ensure that:

- You fully understand your own work.
- You can demonstrate your thought process and explain how different parts of your project come together.
- You gain confidence in debugging and improving your project.

If you need help understanding any part of your code before the presentation, please reach out! Iâ€™m happy to clarify anything.

Since we cannot cover every possible example needed before your midterm is due here are a few links to some W3Schools tutorials you might find helpful. If you use these tutorials in your project, be prepared to discuss how the code works, especially if it incorporates anything other than HTML/CSS!
