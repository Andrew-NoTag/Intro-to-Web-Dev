# Final Project Breakdown

### [Presentation Schedule](PresentationSchedule.md)

> #### _Everyone's final project documentation and working code is due on **Tuesday, May 6th** (Before class begins)._

Your final should demonstrate everything you’ve learned this semester, with a clear purpose, solid structure, and **JavaScript interactivity**.

### Your Final Site:

- **A working website deployed via GitHub Pages**
- Includes **JavaScript interactivity** (this must be present and functional)
- Has a **thoughtful design** (styling and layout should be part of the project goals, not an afterthought)

### Your Documentation Should Include:

- A link to your **deployed site**
- A short summary of what your project does
- A screenshot or screen recording of your site
- A **code snippet** you’re proud of or learned something from and explanation on how it works
- Notes on:
  - What you struggled with
  - What you’re proud of
  - What you would add next if you had more time

_Documentation should be in a .md file in your class repository._

### Class Presentations

On your designated day, you’ll give a presentation (10 minutes, including class feedback) walking us through:

- What your site does
- Live Demo
- The JavaScript features you implemented
- What you learned and how you grew as a developer
- Your design choices and inspiration

Be ready to answer questions about your code and your design!

Feel free to make slides or use your project documentation file for your presentation!
