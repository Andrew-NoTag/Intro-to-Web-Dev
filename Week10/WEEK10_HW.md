### Overview

This assignment will help you practice the core JavaScript concepts we learned in class this week, including variables, expressions, functions, data type conversion, and loops.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Hello World

Create an HTML file with an external JavaScript file. Use the JavaScript file to:

- Display "Hello World!" using an alert
- Log "My first JavaScript assignment" to the console
- Change the text of an HTML element with the id "output" to say "I just modified this element with JavaScript"

### Task 2: Variable Practice

In your JavaScript file, create the following variables:

- A string variable with your name
- An integer variable with your age
- A float variable with your favorite number (including a decimal)
- Use these variables to log a message to the console that says: "My name is [yourName], I am [yourAge] years old, and my favorite number is [yourNumber]."

### Task 3: Calculator Function

Create a function called `calculate` that:

- Takes two parameters (numbers)
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers
- Logs the results to the console with descriptive messages
- Call this function with at least three different pairs of numbers

### Task 4: Temperature Converter

Create two functions:

- `fahrenheitToCelsius` - Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
- `celsiusToFahrenheit` - Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit

The formulas are:

- C = (F - 32) \* 5/9
- F = C \* 9/5 + 32

Add buttons to your HTML that call these functions with hardcoded values and display the results using alerts.

### Task 5: String Manipulation

Create a function that:

- Takes a string parameter
- Converts it to all uppercase
- Counts the number of characters
- Returns a message with both pieces of information
- Display the result using an alert

### Task 6: Toggle Switch

Create a boolean variable called `isLightOn` set to `true`
Create a function that:

- Toggles the boolean value (if true, change to false; if false, change to true)
- Changes the text of an element to indicate the current state ("Light is ON" or "Light is OFF")
- Add a button that calls this function

### Task 7: Counting Loop

Create a function called `countByTwo` that:

- Takes a number parameter
- Uses a for loop to count from 0 to that number, incrementing by 2 each time
- Displays each value in an HTML element
- Add a button that calls this function with the value 20

### Submission

Push your HTML file and JavaScript file to you class repository.
