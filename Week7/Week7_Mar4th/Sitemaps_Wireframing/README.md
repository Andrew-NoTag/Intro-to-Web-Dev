# Sitemaps & Wireframing

### Why Do We Use Sitemaps & Wireframes?

#### Why Plan a Website?

Before you build a house, what do you need?"
**Blueprints!**

Just like a house needs a blueprint, a website needs a plan before coding.

Sitemaps and wireframes help us plan how a site is structured and what each page looks like.

### Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of a website’s structure.

It shows how pages are connected and helps organize content before coding.

- Home
  - About
  - Projects
    - Project 1
    - Project 2
  - Contact

Or a more visual example:

This shows how all the pages are linked. Before coding, we need to decide what pages exist and how users navigate.

### Wireframe

A wireframe is a simple sketch of a webpage layout.

It shows where elements like headers, images, and buttons will go—without colors, fonts, or styling.

Think of it as a rough draft before designing the final website.

> This is just a quick layout sketch. No colors, no fonts—just structure. This helps developers and designers figure out placement before writing any code.
