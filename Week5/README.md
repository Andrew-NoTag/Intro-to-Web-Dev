## Homework Due February 25th

### Checklist:

1. **Prep**

   [ ] Add link for your Web Dev repository to the [class sheet](<(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mypPKpLeb8K2L3tSgLmB0cUEQaopdfFvYwfKA70r1gQ/edit?usp=sharing)>)

2. **Coding**

   [ ] README.md recipe page

   [ ] index.html recipe page

3. **Other**

   [ ] Overview markdown cheat sheet

   [ ] Look through the Information Architecture File **and** _or_ watch the [What is Information Architecture? (UX Design Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJLfjgVlwDo) video

   [ ] .md file with key notes you learned about Information Architecture.

### Details:

Add your github repo link to the [class roster google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mypPKpLeb8K2L3tSgLmB0cUEQaopdfFvYwfKA70r1gQ/edit?usp=sharing).

> All assignments must be pushed to your repository by **7:59 AM** the date it is due unless otherwise stated.

Take a look at this [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You will be using markdown files to document your work in this class.

> **Note:** You will have a folder for every week you submit your assignments.

In your repository folder in VS Code create a "Week05" folder and add a `README.md` file and `index.html` file. You will write a recipe page in both Markdown and HTML.

The recipe card should contain:

- A heading (that is also a link to the original recipe)
- A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
- Brief description of the recipe
- List of ingredients
- List of instructions

- Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class this week.

Next class we will be going straight to **Routes, Directories, Links, and URLS**. But, before building a site, we need think about our pages. Not just how content is organized on a page, but also how information is organized site wide.

So please go over the Information Architecture File **and** _or_ watch the [What is Information Architecture? (UX Design Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJLfjgVlwDo) video before next class.

In a `.md` file write key notes you learned about Information Architecture.
