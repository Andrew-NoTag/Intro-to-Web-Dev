## Class Warm-Up: Debugging Loops

Today we’re kicking off class with a warm-up focused on loop debugging.

You’ll look at a series of small code snippets with broken or buggy loops, and your job is to figure out what’s wrong and fix it so that the output displays correctly on the page.

### Find the starter files in the InClass folder or the links below.

### [Warmup.html](./InClass/Warmup.html)

### [Warmup.js](./InClass/Warmup.js)

We'll go over answers together after everyone has had a chance to test and fix each example.
