### Exploring an API

Your goal is to **find a public API that interests you**, explore how it works, and create a simple webpage that displays at least **one piece of data** from that API using `fetch`.

#### Requirements

- Find a **public API** that does **not** require authentication (no API key) — or one that offers easy signup and clear instructions.
- Use `fetch()` (or `async/await`) to retrieve data from the API.
- Display **at least one meaningful piece of data** (e.g., a name, image, description) on your webpage.
- Use basic HTML and JavaScript to show the result.
- Style it however you'd like — even minimal styling is okay.

#### Example APIs

Here are a few public APIs you might explore:

- [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.vercel.app)
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
- [Dog CEO Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- [OpenWeather (with API key)](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Or explore:

- [GitHub Repo for public APIs #1](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [GitHub Repo for public APIs #2](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

#### Submit

- A link to your HTML file (or upload it to GitHub and submit the repo)

Please fill out the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/zakLZxirnq2Xos5RA) before 6pm April 16th.

    As we head into the final few weeks of class, I want to shape the remainder of our time around what you're most interested in exploring further.

    This form is your chance to vote on topics you’d like to go deeper into or try out for the first time.

    Choose how excited you are about each option (1 = not interested, 5 = very interested).

### Finals

Start thinking about your final!

Will you be using a public API? What kind of functions will you need to write? Are you expanding on your midterm or something completely new?

Nothing needs to be submitted yet, I just want you to start the ideation process!
