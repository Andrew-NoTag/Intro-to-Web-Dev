# Web Development Practice (Due 03/25)

As discussed in class, during Spring Break you will create a **_simple_** webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript portion only needs to change an element of your HTML or CSS dynamically. For a refresher, check out this [JavaScript Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp).

### Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to practice and reinforce the skills we've covered in class. This exercise will help you keep your "muscle memory" active during spring break. Your webpage can be as simple or as complex as you'd like.

### Example:

Here is an [example webpage](https://samdear.github.io/All_in_One/index.html) that incorporates everything we've learned so far. Feel free to create your own page as simple as you'd like, but make sure it demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Submission:

Place the webpage's files in your class repository.

### Have fun and enjoy your break!
