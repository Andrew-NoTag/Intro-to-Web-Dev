### Details:

In class we all made Github accounts and downloaded VS Code. To prepare for next class, you must have set up Git and authenticated your Github account.

- GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. You can use it as a backup of your git repositories, or to collaborate as a team on a project. We will be using it to keep track of our in class, and homework files.

  - [Create your GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

- Git is a widely used version control software which we can access via the command line of our computers. You most likely have Git installed on your computer, but if for any reason any of the commands in this tutorial tell you to install Git, follow the link below.

  - [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

  - Next, we need to set up Git and Authenticate our GitHub account. [Follow the instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

- Next class we will be *running* through the HTML basics. To prepare for the faster pace watch over the first 25 minutes of this [HTML with Visual Studio Code | Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzWdtSGRVNo)

- Optional: Watch and go through the [Introduction to VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) tutorial to get comfortable on the platform.
