    [ ] Overview markdown cheat sheet
    
    [ ] Look through the Information Architecture File **and** _or_ watch the [What is Information Architecture? (UX Design Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJLfjgVlwDo) video

    [ ] .md file with key notes you learned about Information Architecture. 

### Details:

Add your github repo link to the [class roster google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mypPKpLeb8K2L3tSgLmB0cUEQaopdfFvYwfKA70r1gQ/edit?usp=sharing).

>All assignments must be pushed to your repository by **7:59 AM** the date it is due unless otherwise stated.

Take a look at this [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You will be using markdown files to document your work in this class.

- In your Week05 HW folder create an `index.html` file containing a recipe card. The recipe card should contain:

  - A simple home page with a link that leads to a recipe page

  Recipe page:
  - A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
  - Brief description of the recipe
  - List of ingredients
  - List of instructions

- Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class this week.

Next class we will be going straight to **Routes, Directories, Links, and URLS**. But, before building a site, we need think about our pages. Not just how content is organized on a page, but also how information is organized site wide. 

So please go over the Information Architecture File **and** _or_ watch the [What is Information Architecture? (UX Design Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJLfjgVlwDo) video before next class. In a .md file write key notes you learned about Information Architecture.
