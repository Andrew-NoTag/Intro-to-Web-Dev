### In class activity: Chaotic website design

Start designing a "chaotic" gallery page using as many of today's CSS techniques as possible.

I encourage you to talk to your classmates! Share what you discover, ask questions, and get inspiration from each other.

If you see someone doing something cool, ask them how they did it! This is how creative coding communities work in the real world.

### Why Are We Doing This?

Web design is often taught with a focus on structure and usability, but experimentation and rule breaking are just as important for understanding how code works. This activity helps you:

- **Get Comfortable with Code:** Instead of just following instructions, you’ll explore and play with CSS to see how things interact.

- **Learn by Doing:** Hands-on experimentation with transitions, transformations, and styling will help solidify what you’ve learned.

- **Develop Debugging Skills:** When things get chaotic (and they will!), you’ll get better at figuring out what’s happening and why.

- **Encourage Creativity:** Coding isn’t just about making things functional—it can be expressive, playful, and even weird!
